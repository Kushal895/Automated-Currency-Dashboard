\## üéØ Project Objective



The goal of this project was to design and build a professional, end-to-end business intelligence pipeline. The system automatically fetches daily and historical currency exchange rate data, processes and stores it in a cloud-based data store, and visualizes the insights through a dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard. The entire workflow is 100% automated, requiring no manual intervention.

\## üß∞ Tech Stack \& Architecture



This project utilizes a modern, serverless architecture to create a robust and scalable data pipeline.



| Technology | Role |

| :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Python\*\* | The core engine for automation, data fetching, and processing. |

| \*\*Pandas Library\*\* | Used for cleaning, transforming, and structuring the raw API data. |

| \*\*Requests Library\*\*| Used to perform HTTP requests to the financial data API. |

| \*\*Google Cloud Platform\*\*| Provided the essential APIs for cloud integration. |

| \*\*Google Sheets \& Drive APIs\*\*| Used by the Python script to programmatically update the cloud data store. |

| \*\*Google Sheets\*\* | Acted as a reliable, serverless cloud database for the project's data. |

| \*\*Power BI\*\* | The business intelligence tool used for data modeling, analysis, and visualization. |

| \*\*DAX\*\* | Used extensively within Power BI to create complex calculated measures like Moving Averages, Volatility, and Dynamic Summaries. |

| \*\*Git \& GitHub\*\* | Used for version control and professional project showcasing. |

\## üîÑ Automation Workflow



The system is automated in two stages:



1\.  \*\*Backend (Python):\*\* A Python script (`update\_sheets.py`) is scheduled to run daily via Windows Task Scheduler. It fetches the latest rates from the Frankfurter API and appends them to the master Google Sheet.

2\.  \*\*Frontend (Power BI):\*\* The published Power BI report is configured with a Scheduled Refresh in the Power BI Service. It automatically pulls the new data from the Google Sheet each day, ensuring the dashboard is always up-to-date.

\## ‚ú® Key Features



\* \*\*End-to-End Automation:\*\* No manual steps are required to update the data or the dashboard.

\* \*\*Interactive Navigation:\*\* The Main Page acts as a hub. Clicking on any currency card seamlessly navigates the user to a dedicated detail page for that currency using Power BI's bookmarking feature.

\* \*\*Rich Data Visualization:\*\* The dashboard includes a variety of visuals to provide deep insights:

&nbsp;   \* KPI Cards for latest rate, all-time high/low, and daily % change.

&nbsp;   \* Historical Trend Chart with 7-day and 30-day moving averages to identify trends.

&nbsp;   \* Recent Volatility Chart showing daily performance over the last 60 days.

\* \*\*Dynamic Text Summaries:\*\* A natural-language summary on each detail page is generated automatically using DAX, explaining the currency's current performance and historical context.

\* \*\*Cloud-Based Architecture:\*\* Leverages Google Cloud APIs and Google Sheets as a data store, demonstrating modern, serverless data engineering practices.

\## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up



1\.  \*\*Clone the repository.\*\*

2\.  \*\*Set up Google Cloud Credentials:\*\*

&nbsp;   \* Follow the Google Cloud documentation to create a Service Account.

&nbsp;   \* Enable the Google Drive and Google Sheets APIs.

&nbsp;   \* Generate a JSON key and place it in the project root.

&nbsp;   \* Create a Google Sheet and share it with the service account's client email.

3\.  \*\*Install Python libraries:\*\*

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   pip install -r requirements.txt

&nbsp;   ```

4\.  \*\*Run the script\*\* to perform the initial historical data load:

&nbsp;   ```bash

&nbsp;   python update\_sheets.py

&nbsp;   ```

5\.  \*\*Open the `.pbix` file\*\* in Power BI Desktop and point the data source to your own Google Sheet.
